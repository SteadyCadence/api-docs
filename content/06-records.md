## Spatial Units (a.k.a Project Locations)


Projects in the Cadasta Platform are spatial in nature – collections of points, lines, and polygons representing areas where land rights documentation is happening. These points, lines, and polygons can be retrieved and modified using the Cadasta API.  

_<a href="https://docs.cadasta.org/en/04-records.html#project-locations" target="_blank">Read more about Project Locations in our Platform Documentation</a>_

The endpoint you need to access JSON for spatial units / project locations starts like this: `/api/v1/organizations/{organization_slug}/projects/{project_slug}/spatial/`


### Spatial Unit JSON Object

A spatial unit / project location JSON object is a [GEOJSON object](http://geojson.org/) contains the following properties: 

Property | Type | Description
---|---|---
`type` | `String` | This field is automatically set to `Feature`.
`geometry` | `Object` | A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON#Geometries" target="_blank"> GeoJSON representation</a> of the spatial unit's geometry. 
`properties` | `Object` | An object that gives the location a unique ID, defines the type of location it is (land `types`), and lists any attributes. (See  the `properties` table below for more information)

The `properties` object contains the following properties:

Property | Type | Description
---|---|---
`id` | `String` |  A unique ID for the spatial unit
`type` | `String` | The type of spatial unit that it is, defined by the fields in your questionnaire. (See the land `types` table below )
`attributes` | `Object` | Project-specific attributes that are defined through the projects questionnaire. 

**Land `type` Abbreviations**

If you need to plot out the land `types`, these are the abbreviations you need:

Abbreviation | What it Represents
--- | ---
`PA` | Parcel
`CB` | Community Boundary
`BU` | Building
`AP` | Apartment
`PX` | Project Extent
`RW` | Right-of-way
`NP` | National Park Boundary
`MI` | Miscellaneous

## Relationships

Each location has a relationship with one or more parties, and each of those parties has a specific type of relationship with the land. For example, a municipal body may own a park, and a local tribe may have right-of-way access to it. Ownership and right-of-way-access are both types of relationships. (Note that sometimes you may also see the word "tenure" in lieu of or alongside the word "relationship.")

The Cadasta API allows you to list relationships of a party and list relationships to a spatial unit / project location. You can also get, create, update, and delete relationships as well.

Endpoints in this section start with:

```
/api/v1/organizations/{organization_slug}/projects/{project_slug}/parties/{party_id}/relationships/
```

or

```
/api/v1/organizations/{organization_slug}/projects/{project_slug}/spatial/{spatial_unit_id}/relationships/
```

or

```
/api/v1/organizations/{organization_slug}/projects/{project_slug}/relationships/tenure/{relationship_id}/
```

### Relationship JSON object

A relationship object contains the following properties:


Property | Type | Description 
--- | --- | --- 
`rel_class`| `String` | The type of relationships; currently `"tenure"` is the only possible relationship type.
`id` | `String`  | The unique ID of the relationship
`party` | `Array` | The object containing the party that the spatial unit is related to. (See the `party` table below for more information.)
`spatial_unit` | `Object` | The spatial unit / project location object. (See the `spatial unit` table below for more information.)
`tenure_type`| `String` |  The kind of relationship. (See the Relationship (Tenure) Categories table for more information.)
`attributes`| `Object`  | Project-specific attributes that are defined through the project's questionnaire. 

The `party` object has the following properties: 

Property | Type | Description 
--- | --- | --- 
`id` | `String` | The unique ID of the party. 
`name` | `String` | The name of the party.
`type` | `String` |  The type of party, e.g. an individual (`IN`), a group (`GR`), or a corporation (`CO`).

The `spatial_unit` object has the following properties:

Property | Type | Description 
--- | --- | --- 
`type` | `String` | Type of spatial unit; automatically set to `Feature`.
`geometry` | `Object` |  A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON#Geometries" target="_blank"> GeoJSON representation</a> of the spatial unit's geometry.
`properties` | `Object` | An object that gives the location a unique ID and defines the type of location it is (land `types`). (See  the `properties` table below for more information)

```

#### List relationships to a spatial unit

```endpoint
GET /api/v1/organizations/{organization_slug}/projects/{project_slug}/spatial/{spatial_unit_id}/relationships/
```

URL Parameter | Description
---|---
`organization_slug` | The slug provided for the organization, which can be found by locating the organization in the [list of all organizations](#list-organizations).
`project_slug` | The slug provided for the project, which can be found by [listing all of the projects in an organization](#list-all-projects).
`party_id` | **Only required when listing relationships to a party.** The unique ID generated for the specific party, which can be found by [listing all of the parties](#list-parties). 
`spatial_unit_id` | **Only required when listing relationships to a spatial unit.** The unique ID generated for the specific spatial unit, which can be found by [listing all of the spatial units](#list-spatial-units--project-locations).
