## Managing a User Account

People who want to do more than view publicly available organizations and projects, individuals who use the Cadasta Platform are required to <a href="https://docs.cadasta.org/en/01-gettingstarted.html#createnewaccount" target="_blank">set up a user account</a>. 

You can use the Cadasta API to manage these accounts, provided that you have their username and password. This section outlines how to do that, focusing on endpoints that start with `api/v1/account/`.

### Account object

An `account` JSON object contains the following properties:

Property | Type Description
---|---|---
`username` | `String` | The user's username (30 characters or fewer. Letters, digits and @/./+/-/_ only.)
`full_name` | `String` | The user's full name.
`email` | `String` | The user's email address.
`email_verified` | `Boolean` | Indicates whether the user has verified their email address.
`last_login` | `String` | Date and time of last user login.

#### Example Account JSON Object

```json
{
    "username": "janedoe",
    "full_name": "Jane Doe",
    "email": "jane@cadasta.org",
    "email_verified": true,
    "last_login": "2016-10-25T20:20:14.192918Z"
}
```


### Log a User In / Get Authorization Key

```endpoint
POST /api/v1/account/login/
```

Getting your authorization token is one of the first things you need to do before using the Cadasta Platform API. That's because many endpoints of Cadasta's API require an authenticated user. To authenticate a user, you need to sign API requests with an authorization token, which you can obtain by logging the user in.

_Note that logging a user into the API does not log them into the platform._


**Request Payload**

Property | Type | Required? | Description
---|---|:---:|---
`password` | `String` | x | The user's password.
`username` | `String` | x | The user's username.

**Response**

The response contains a JSON object with the following properties:

Property | Type | Description
---|---|---
`auth_token` | `String` | The authorization token. Use it to sign requests to the API.

#### Example Response

```json
{
  "auth_token": "UER33kHWhdLPq9nKkvENFtLvu3FF68GQ"
}
```











### Log a User Out 

```endpoint
POST /api/v1/account/logout/
```
Logging a user out removes their authorization token. Requests cannot be signed with any token obtained previously.

Note that logging a user out of the API does not log them out of the platform.

**Response**

When the logout was successful, you receive an empty response with status code `200`.












### Register a New User / Create a New User Account


```endpoint
POST /api/v1/account/register/
```

Use this method and endpoint to register a new user to the platform. Note that this does not log the user in; simply creates a new account for them.

If you would like to use the command line, you could use a line like this: 

```
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username": "Name","full_name": "Full Name","email": "email@address.com","password": "p@sswordCADASTA"}' https://platform.cadasta.org/api/v1/account/register/
```


**Request Payload**
